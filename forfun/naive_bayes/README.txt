Coding challenge for Squarespace:
-Was told to predict presidential winners given various feature and training data.
-Implemented naive bayes classifier with gaussian normal distribution assumption.
-Split up training data into 80% train and 20% test.
-Results indicated 60% success at prediction
-Not the right time to assume gaussian distribution..
LOL
